const LONG_ABOUT: &str = "Shared Memory Bridge facilitates sharing memory between Windows\n\

                          way to access and manipulate named shared memory spaces across these\n\
                          platforms. It's particularly useful in gaming and simulations, allowing\n\
                          Linux applications to directly read data from Windows applications.\n\n\
                          Example Usage:\n\n\
                          To launch the bridge and view command line options, use the following \
                          command:\n    \
                              protontricks-launch --appid APPID shm-bridge.exe\n\n\
                          This will display help output and available options for `shm-bridge`,\n\
                          guiding you through the necessary steps to set up and run the bridge\n\
                          within your specific environment.";
