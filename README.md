# Shared memory bridge

Share memory between a Windows application running under Wine/Proton and Linux.

This allows you to expose [named shared memory] a Windows application uses under
Linux. The Linux application can then [`mmap(2)`] the named shared memory file and
read its data.

## History

This is a Rust port of [`oculus-wine-wrapper`]. The main difference here is
that [`oculus-wine-wrapper`] exposed an existing `/dev/shm` backed file, that
the `oculusd` daemon creates, as [named shared memory] using Wine.

We on the other hand go the other direction. We want to re-expose named shared
memory a Windows executable creates under Linux. For this to work, we first
create a file on a [`tmpfs`] file system, then we create the named shared memory
mapping, backed by the [`tmpfs`] file. We need to create the named shared memory
before the Windows executable does, then it will just reuse the, now [`tmpfs`]
backed named shared memory as if it created it itself.

        file <==> shared_memory
    end

    linux <==> bridge
    bridge <==> windows
```

Once the Windows application uses the named shared memory we created, the data
the Windows application exposes using the named shared memory will be found in
the [`tmpfs`] file as well. Linux applications then can just open and [`mmap(2)`]
the [`tmpfs`] file to read shared memory.

## Installation 

The installation of `shm-bridge` requires [Rust], we're going to assume that you
have already [installed Rust][rust-install]. Since this is a Windows application
that is meant to be run under Wine/Proton you'll have to add a Windows target to
your Rust installation.

```bash
$ rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

After the target has been installed, `shm-bridge` can be installed using
[`cargo`]. From the root directory of the project, launch:

```bash
$ cargo install
```

## Usage

The bridge requires to be run under Wine or Proton, it's recommended to install
[`protontricks`] for ease of use.


The bridge should be launched inside the container of the application:

```bash
$ protontricks-launch --appid APPID shm-bridge.exe
```

### Finding the application ID

To find out the `APPID` you can use `protontricks` itself:

```bash
$ protontricks -s "Assetto Corsa"

Found the following games:
Assetto Corsa Competizione (805550)

To run Protontricks for the chosen game, run:
$ protontricks APPID COMMAND

NOTE: A game must be launched at least once before Protontricks can find the game.
```

### Launching the bridge

Now you can launch the bridge in the container of the game:

```bash
$ protontricks-launch --appid 805550 shm-bridge.exe

Found a tmpfs filesystem at /dev/shm/
Created a tmpfs backed mapping for acpmf_crewchief with size 15660
Created a tmpfs backed mapping for acpmf_static with size 2048
Created a tmpfs backed mapping for acpmf_physics with size 2048
Created a tmpfs backed mapping for acpmf_graphics with size 2048
All mappings were successfully created, press CTRL-C to exit.

```

## Supported titles

The shared memory bridge currently supports the following titles:

* [Assetto Corsa][ac]
* [Assetto Corsa Competizione][acc]

### Assetto Corsa / Assetto Corsa Competizione

To access the shared memory you can [`shm_open(3)`] and [`mmap(2)`] the files
listed in the output of `shm-bridge.exe`.

For example, if we run the bridge we will see an output like:

```
...
Found a tmpfs filesystem at /dev/shm/
Created a tmpfs backed mapping for acpmf_static with size 2048
...
```

This tells us that we can open a file under `/dev/shm/acpmf_static` and map the
memory into our process. To interpret the bytes in the file, you'll have to use
structures from the games SDK. The [simapi] project contains definitions of such
structures, alternatively the Rust library [simetry] contains them as well.

To quickly test if the bridge correctly works you can also use some applications
that use [simapi], for example [gilles]. Another option would be to use one of
the examples in the [simetry] repository:

```bash
$ cargo run --example assetto_corsa_competizione_get_data

```

**Warning**: This example currently requires the usage of a fork of [simetry],
which can be found at: https://github.com/poljar/simetry/

## Development

To modify and develop `shm-bridge` you'll have to install [Rust] and the Windows
Rust target, please take a look at the [installation](#installation) section.

Cargo has been set up to use the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target by default. This
means that, once the correct target has been installed, `cargo
check`, `build`, or `install` work as expected. Wine has been set up as the
default runner, which makes `cargo run` work.

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling shm-bridge v0.1.0 (/home/poljar/werk/simracing/shm-bridge)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.36s

Created a tmpfs backed mapping for acpmf_graphics with size 2048

```

## Similar/Related Projects

A couple of similar projects exists in various languages, they all seem to
require multiple binaries, one Linux binary to create the `/dev/shm` backed files
and one Windows binary to create the named shared memory utilizing the file.
